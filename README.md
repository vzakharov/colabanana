# Colabanana ‚Äî test your üçå Banana environment with Colab

[Banana](banana.dev) is a framework to serve ML models in production using simple HTTP servers. This repository contains a template for building a Banana-compatible model that you can, by copying and pasting, deploy to and test on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Why bother?

Banana is a great tool for serving ML models in production, but it can be a bit tricky to test, as it has no debugging capabilities, the deploying process takes a while, and actually running the model costs quite a bit. Although there are ML testing platforms out there such as [Brev](https://brev.dev/), they require quite a bit of hacking to get to work, especially for ~~someone as stupid as me~~ Windows users. It is not free either. (But seriously, Brev is great, and you should check it out.)

Colab, on the other hand, is a (mostly) free, easy-to-use, and powerful platform for building and testing ML models. Besides, it‚Äôs a tool many ML practitioners like myself are already familiar with. So why not use it to test your Banana models?

So I went ahead and created this template. Basically it‚Äôs based on (and is a fork of) Banana‚Äôs [serverless template](https://github.com/bananaml/serverless-template) with a few modifications to make it work with Colab. It‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî copying and pasting the code from your `py` files into the Colab notebook is a bit tedious and prone to errors ‚Äî but hey, it works.

If, like me, you suck at infrastructure and just want to get your model server up and running, this might be for you.

## How to use this template

1. Clone this repository

2. Edit `download.py`, `app.py`, `test.py` and `requirements.txt` to your liking (read the [serverless framework guide](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework) for more information).

3. Create a new Colab notebook from `colabana.ipynb` or copy the template one located [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ODP4Aw8cPRB2xcH8y-Tl5unib0jdfwHZ).

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run and test your model with Colab.

5. Once done testing, deploy your model to Banana as described in the [serverless framework guide](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework).

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that you understand the basics of Banana. If you don't, please refer to the [Banana documentation](https://banana.dev/docs), most importantly:

- The [Quickstart guide](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/quickstart)
- The [Serverless Framework guide](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework)
