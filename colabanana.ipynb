    "# Colabanana — test your 🍌 Banana environment with Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple notebook to test your [Banana serverless](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework) environments right from your browser. It is assumed that you already know the core concepts of Banana and have downloaded/cloned the [Colabanana repo](https://github.com/vzakharov/colabanana) from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Banana and its serverless framework, please refer to the [Banana docs](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on why this notebook exists, please refer to the [Colabanana repo](https://github.com/vzakharov/colabanana).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open this notebook in Colab. (Funny because you are already here but hey, you never know.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go one by one through the cells and either edit them as suggested or enter the required information in the forms attached to them. I tried giving as much information as needed in each cell, so I won’t repeat it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once done, go `Runtime` > `Run all` and watch the magic happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is already pre-populated to use the HuggingFace [fill-mask](https://huggingface.co/tasks/fill-mask) model, so you can test it right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that working with the notebook will involve a lot of copying and pasting between your `.py` files and respective cells in the notebook, but that’s the price you pay for the convenience of using Colab. (I strongly suggest that you do the editing in your `.py` files and then copy-paste the code into the notebook, not the other way around.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once everything works perfectly, you can proceed to deploy your model to a serverless environment according to the [Banana docs](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework). You shouldn’t need any changes to your `.py` files for that. Well, at least *theoretically*."
